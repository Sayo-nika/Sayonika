# The Sayonika Project

Welcome to the Sayonika Project! This is your stop point for everything Sayonika, here are a few repositories you can contribute at.

## What is the Sayonika Project?

The Sayonika project is a mod distribution platform and tooling incubation for Doki Doki Literature Club. This is a partnership
project initiated by [Enra](https://github.com/sr229) and [Logokas](https://reddit.com/u/Logokas) to further simplify how mods
are being catalogued officially by the r/DDLCMods team. It also serves as a technological incubation to improve creation and
distributing mods - with open source!


We use donations to power the website, so drop us money to buy us a coffee at [PayPal](https://paypal.me/chinodesuuu) or buy a [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/capuccino)!


If you have questions or just wanna have fun, feel free to join the [Sayonika Commons](https://discord.gg/sGUkGc8) discord.
