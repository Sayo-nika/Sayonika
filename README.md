Welcome to the Sayonika Project! This is your stop point for everything Sayonika, here are a few repositories you can contribute at.

## What is the Sayonika Project?

The Sayonika project is a mod distribution platform and tooling incubation for Doki Doki Literature Club. This is a partnership
project initiated by [Enra](https://github.com/sr229) and [Logokas](https://reddit.com/u/Logokas) to further simplify how mods
are being catalogued officially by the r/DDLCMods team. It also serves as a technological incubation to improve creation and
distributing mods - with open source!
